                    <h2>Types of skates</h2>
                    
                    <h3>The two most common types of skates are figure (shown left) and hockey skates (right). Most beginners opt for figure skates. Figure skate blades have a ragged top edge for more control, while hockey skates have a straight blade. It is very important to get fitted at a <a href="https://www.chelseapiers.com/sr/pro-shop/" target="_blank">professional store </a>for your first pair. </h3>

                    <h3>It's really important to tie your skates carefully and tightly. Loosen all the way to the bottom, then gradually tighten as you work up. The laces should be tightest around the ankle area, then slightly looser and snugger as you reach the top. Make sure to ensure the laces are not too tight though, or else, your feel will feel numb. It will definitely take a few tries to get it right, so don't be afraid to ask the rink staff or a pro store to help you. There are also lots of <a href="https://youtu.be/p9mpKDn-KuI" target="_blank">Youtube</a> videos to help you learn how to tie your skates, so go ahead and look them up!</h3>

                    <h3>Youtube hosts plenty of skating videos which will make you comfortable about getting onto the ice for the first time! I strongly recommend this one from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=ice+coach+online" target="_blank">Ice Coach Online</a>, who have a series of ice skating videos. He breaks everything down very simply for beginners. Watching all his videos and remembering the basics will definitely help you overcome your initial fears!</h3>
