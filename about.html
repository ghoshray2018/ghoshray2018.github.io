                    <h3>Some 20 years ago in Europe, Monica found herself on an ice-skating rink in Switzerland, where she was an exchange student from a college in London. She launched herself on the ice, blissfully ignorant of any techniques or moves, and within an hour, had collected numerous bruises everywhere on her body. The pain lasted for over three days, and she vowed never to try it again.
                    
                    <p>In 2018, her daughter expresed a strong interest in ice-skating, and urged her parents to take lessons with her at <a href="https://www.chelseapiers.com/sr/" target="_blank">Chelsea Piers.</a> The panic came flooding back, but she enrolled herself in adult lessons. It was the most frightening thing given earlier memories, but educating herself with online videos and armed with a <a href="https://www.mindsetworks.com/science/" target="_blank">Growth Mindset</a>, she has gradually been able to take baby steps towards skating properly and banishing her fears as an adult.</p>
                    
                    <p>When she isn't donning her skating boots on a weekend, Monica loves to spend time with her family and teach her wonderful 4th graders on the UES.</p></h3>
