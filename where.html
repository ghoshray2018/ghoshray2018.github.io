                    <h3>In NYC, Central Park's <a href="http://www.centralparknyc.org/things-to-see-and-do/attractions/wollman-rink.html" target="_blank">Wollman Rink </a>is one of the world's prettiest outdoor rinks. Surrounded by majestic skyscrapers and greenery, it is on most skater's and non-skater's bucket list because of its setting. It has featured in several major movies like Serendipity, and nothing beats a skating session during the holiday season with holiday classics in the background. You don't have to be an experienced skater at all to join in the fun!! <a href="http://www.centralparknyc.org/things-to-see-and-do/attractions/wollman-rink.html" target="_blank">Sign Up</a> for classes online/dropping in/calling. Ask about their season pass, as it offers unlimited lessons and rink time at a good price - if you can spend lots of time skating.</h3>

                    <h3>Like Central Park, <a href="https://bryantpark.org/amenities/bank-of-america-winter-village-at-bryant-park" target="_blank">Bryant Park</a> in NYC transforms from a green playspace in the summer to a winter wonderland in the holiday season. This rink is free, so it can get really crowded. I would personally recommend Wollman Rink for more space to practice, and Bryant Park for fun with friends and family once you gain confidence with skating. However you can also sign up for skating lessons <a href="https://bryantpark.org/programs/skate-school" target="blank">here</a>. It's very beautiful and has a more urban feel. Chill between sessions with some mulled wine as you enjoy the snow, music, and ice!</h3>

New York offers a multitude of choices when it comes to year-round skating, and one of the most popular options sits within Chelsea Piers - the <a href="https://www.chelseapiers.com/sr/" target="_blank">Sky Rink.</a> It's a powerhouse when it comes to premium instruction and facilities. There is an on-site <a href="https://www.chelseapiers.com/sr/pro-shop/" target="_blank">pro-skating</a> store where you can get your skates sharpened and fitted for all levels of skates, ranging from beginners to hockey players. You can enroll for both private or group lessons. Public general skate sessions and skates are included for group lessons.</h3>

It dates back to the 18th century, and is a vibrant center of arts and culture in the city. In the winter, and epecially during Christmas, it is magically transformed into an ice-skating rink overlooked by imposing Neoclassical architecture. There is a children's/adult beginner's mini-rink adjacent to the main one, to allow novices to get comfortable, or simply enjoy a relaxing session. Next to the rink is a cozy pop-up bar which serves alcoholic, non-alchoholic beverages, and snacks. On select weekends, there is even a live DJ spinning the latest dance tunes! </h3>
